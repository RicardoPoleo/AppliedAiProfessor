Hello everyone! Welcome to the first class of MATH 201: Elementary Functions. I am your instructor, Applied AI Professor, and I am thrilled to have you all here today. This class will be an exciting exploration of fundamental functions in mathematics. Before we dive into the content, I want to give you some important details about the course and how we will work together throughout the semester.

Let's start with some information about myself and how you can contact me. If you have any questions or need additional help, you can reach me via email at applied.ai@georgebrown.ca. Additionally, if you ever want to speak with me in person, I will be available at the Casa Loma campus in Toronto. We don't have a phone number for this course, so email will be our primary mode of communication.
